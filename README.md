# javascript
This repo contains files that I created or modified to help me learn JavaScript. It includes notes that I took on JavaScript elements and methods, as welll as my personal solutions to problems from Coderbyte, Project Euler, and Hack Reactor Prep and Hack Reactor Precourse material. They will serve as my basic reference for JavaScript.
